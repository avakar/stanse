This directory contains several (unreal) examples of faulty C++ programs.

The alloc.cpp and alloc_deleter.cpp should be checked against alloc.xml;
mutex.cpp and virtual.cpp against mutex.xml.
Note that mutex.cpp and virtual.cpp both include mutex.h.

I suggest that the reader browse the alloc.cpp file first
as it contains useful comments.

I've created a .sir file and a pretty-printed .txt file
for each .cpp file. Note that these files are there for your viewing
pleasure only; they are NOT necessary for checking and are NOT created
during checking.

The files can be created as follows (the pretty-printer is a part
of the cpp2sir package).

    $ cpp2sir -j foo.cpp > foo.sir
    $ python pretty-print.py < foo.sir > foo.txt

The alloc_merged.sir was created by merging alloc.sir and alloc_deleter.sir.

    $ python merge.py alloc.sir alloc_deleter.sir > alloc_merged.sir
